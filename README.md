# tictactoe
This is just a project to test my python coding skills. Not a serious project. Feel free to comment or improve the code.

A 2-player tictactoe game played in terminal.

Language: Python 3.6

Displays a 3x3 grid, initially with placeholder numbers indicating the id of the cell. 
Then asks the user for an id to fill in the place with his symbol (X or O).
When a user gets 3 symbols in line(Vertically, Horizontally or diagonally) the game ends with a prompt to restart.
